# Goal
The goal of this application is to give pet owners a platform in which they can share and view infromation about lost pets and communciate with other owners.
# System Overview
PetFind is changing the way that the pet community keeps their animals safe. With this app, anyone can be aware of lost pets in their area, and pet parents don’t have to worry that the rain will ruin their flier or social media won’t reach the person who sees their pet. It is now easier than ever to stay up to date and, should you see a wandering animal, to search and find their family, chat with them, and let them know where you saw their pet, or if you were able to pick them up, to organize a meeting where you could return the pet to its family without divulging personal information like your phone number.
 	It is so important to keep the pet community together so that our furry friends can be kept safe. This platform is an easy and organized way to do so, and to further your reach to animal lovers in your community (or visiting it) that would not see your posts or might miss your fliers.
This app includes a feed where you can scroll through posters near you (or add your own), a search bar where you can enter keywords to find a certain animal in your area, and a contact page to view poster information and connect with the owner.Never miss a connection again when it comes to finding lost pets with PetFind.
